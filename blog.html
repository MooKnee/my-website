        <h3>EQ in an IQ World</h3>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand, 
            manage, and effectively express one's own emotions, as well 
            as engage and navigate successfully with those of others.

            <li><strong>Check your ego, but not your intuition, at the 
                door.</strong> – No one sysprog has all of the answers, 
                and we know this. The mainframe is a field that will 
                teach you something new every day of your career. You 
                can choose to learn kicking and screaming - or you can 
                say "Thank You" and take a lap around the office for a 
                breather. Every mainframer's goal is ensuring production 
                stability, and you will experience some who get a little
                too passionate in expressing why they think their 
                solution is the most safe and efficient. Remember that 
                you are all working towards the same goal, achieveing 
                all the nines of availability, but if something doesn't 
                sit right with you, do speak up!</li>
            <li><strong>Make Friends</strong>Your network is your net 
                worth. Helping others in the office outside of your 
                specific role's capabilities is a great way to make 
                friends, expand your connections, and grow your 
                presence. This is how you get to thrive, not just 
                survive, in a corporate setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Give back - mentor others</strong> – 
                Mentor both people who were in your shoes and those who 
                weren't. Reflect on their experiences, and your own, to 
                assist them in steering their ship.</li>
            <li><strong>When in doubt, be kind.</strong> – 
                You never know what someone is going through.</li>
